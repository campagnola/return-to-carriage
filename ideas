Random Stuff:

- Narrator should be snarky.
"your busted-ass armor has seen better days".
- 2nd 'over' map, showing connections to different maps, be them deeper into dungeons / caves, or further across land
- "Gauntlet" stages? Moving walls, spikes, action based play
- Inventory page - to include current armor and weapons, with lists of inventory to one side 


------------------


Add some more realism to combat / health

    - combat can damage different parts of your body in different ways. 
    - some kinds of damage can slow you down, weaken you, decrease abilities, etc.
    - some kinds of damage require time and rest to heal. 
        - After a bad injury, it may be necessary to exit the dungeon and seek aid. Hopefully you don't bleed out before you get out.
        - Would be cool if critical injuries lead to unconsciousness, but you are more likely to remain conscious as long as danger is nearby
          (example: you lose consciousness a few paces after exiting the dungeon; wake up later in the healer's hut)
    - need water / food / sleep
    - poisons can differ in strength and effect
    - would be nice if healers can give you advice about causes / treatments for your ailments.
    - detailed blow-by-blow logging of activities that lead to health problems so we can learn from our mistakes
    - head wounds can cause amnesia (forget parts of levels, skills, scroll effects, etc)
    
    
-------------------

More realism to skills / memory
    - You can forget parts of the maze that you haven't visited recently or frequently
    - Unused skills degrade over time (but with a realistic memory model)
    - Spells / potions can improve your memory
    - Magic maps


-------------------


Characters die permanently, but dungeons are persistent. 
    - It is possible to leave resources behind for the next adventurer (maps, gold, treasure..)
    - It is possible to encounter the remains of dead adventurers, but there's a good chance their corpse has already been looted.
        (and you might find their stuff in the posession of nearby monsters); items that are found with monsters or found on corpse have undergone regular wear-over-time: see ITEMS section
    - You can spin up a new dungeon, but transferring a character to another dungeon incurs a skill / gold penalty (as if you spent a lot of time and money traveling to the next dungeon)
    - It is possible to find one-time-use spells of ressurect.  
 
--------------------

Inventory management
    - Avoid creating the temptation to mine / sell all items in the dungeon
    - Resale value is very low
    - Most corpses can be looted, but it's unlikely you'll find anything valuable. (crappy weapons, armor that doesn't fit, etc)
    - Realistic inventory - carry as many rings / scrolls as you like, but a spare suit of armor will encumber you.
    - Should be easy to drop pack for combat
    - weapons / armor have realistic degradation (don't get iron wet, on't throw spears at the wall, etc)



--------------------


Detail and perception
    - Lots of detail available if you examine everything
    - Caracters with higher perception will notice more detail, even without manually looking
    - features in the environment have both visibility (how likely you are to notice) and salience (how likely you are to care). 
        whether a feature shows up in the event log depends on (visibility * perception) * salience
    

---------------------

Portals
    - Advanced characters will have rare opportunities to open rifts / portals between levels to avoid long trips in/out of the dungeon
    - Be creative with graphics for these
        - Shift part of the map to open cracks
        - Dynamically open wormhole as you approach the portal
        - Remote end of the portal is visible through the portal 
        
---------------------

Terrain

    - Many types of terrain -- dungeons, caves, forest, water, etc
    - would be cool to have large ground level + multiple entrances to underground
 

    
    
---------------------


Gameplay

    - mixed realtime and turn-based play
    - for multiplayer, turn-based play operates locally
    - most parts gamepad playable
    - Use mouse / js for ranged weapon aiming
        skill affects accuracy
    - combination of rougelike and interactive fiction
        one panel gives a description of the local area
            descriptions can be hierarchical -- terse descriptions can be expanded 
        one panel gives description of character state
        console for entering commands + event log
        
----------------------


Graphics

    Primarily text on a grid, especially early in the game
    Dynamic lighting (torches flicker, fireballs cast moving shadows, etc)
    particles for magic effects / explosions
    Depth? 
        ground level terrain can be 3D
        some parts of levels can be transparent to level below
    Parts of the map that are out of line-of-sight (by that you still remember) are desaturated / dimmed

    Turn-based mode should be identified by boundary via colored floor area        

    Use unicode to represent many different items.
        - mandarin for scrolls / spells
        - kanji for weapons
        - cyrilic for monsters
        If we can work this out such that we start learning other languages, that would
        be fantastic (for example, phonetic symbols always have the same sound
        as the first letter of the english name)

-----------------------


Magic works somewhat like crafting / potion making in other games:

    - Basic magic spell components come in at least two categories:
        - "what" spells: fire, water, ice, healing, teleportation, force, psychic, etc.
        - "how" spells: apply to self, focus in a particular direction, 
           focus on a location, focus on an object, time delay, slow release, etc.
        - each component is represented by one unicode character (maybe mandarin?)
    - To make an effective spell, you usually need to combine at least a "what" with a "how". Examples:
        - fire spell on its own makes a poof of flame that probably harms the caster.
        - If you combine fire with a direction, you get fireball / flame thrower
        - Fire + shield creates a ring of fire around the caster
        - Fire + water + direction creates a blast of steam (or hot water, depending on the ratio)
    - Each component in a spell may be assigned a strength
        - maximum strength is determined by a player attribute
        - probability of success is determined by a _different_ attribute
          (so it's possible to have a prodigy magician who can cast very strong
           spells, but whose inexperience makes such spellcasting dangerous)
    - More complex / specialized / focused spells can be built by combining more basic spells 
        - but complex spells require greater ability
    - Most of the basic spell components are readily found in books (library, magic lessons, etc), 
        but some components may be out of reach for the average caster
        - Some long-forgotten spell components can only be found by adventuring
    - Player can cast any spell by entering the right "recipe"
    - Alternatively, Player can buy / find a blank book in which spell recipes can be recorded and referenced 
        by number / letter for quick use.
    - Many recipes can be found in books, on scrolls, scratched into walls, etc.
        - However, any recipe can be used regardless of whether you read it in a book
        - A user who understands how the elements work and how they interact should be able to 
            create new spells on their own
        - Dungeons shall not be littered with random scrolls and spellbooks.
        - Seriously, those items were looted 30 years ago by the original adventurers.
        (but hey, what if the game is set in a dystopian world 30 years after a horde of adventurers came, 
        looted all the dungeons, and then moved on to better games?)
        - Occasional items can be found on corpses, or in well protected / hidden areas
        - Items can also be purchased from the DND shoppe, or created custom by your local magicperson                    
    - Elements can interact in surprising ways
        - the order of elements can have a subtle effect
        - some elements augment / diminish the strength / duration / reliability of others
    - Your local magicparson can provide training (for a fee). This can increase your levels
    - The maximum strength / duration of a spell, and the probability of 
        casting it correctly, depend on the caster's ability.
        - It is dangerous to cast some spells when part of the spell is likely to fail
            (for example, don't try to cast fireball if there's a good chance the direction part of the spell will fail)
        - If a spell is way over your level, there is a chance of successfully casting the _wrong_ spell.
        - More complex spells will naturally require more skill, as each component has a certain probability
            of failure
        - To avoid making spells too dangerous to use, they should become very reliable
            with practice and after reaching a high enough level.
        - Player's skill is tracked for each element. Practice makes perfect.
            
    
    - Scrolls are one-time use and require no particular magical ability of the user
        - However, powerful scrolls are dangerous if you don't know how to use them properly
          (for example, dont blast the wall next to you with a fireball; the fire will have nowhere to go)
        - It is up to the player to be able to read the scroll and deduce its meaning.
            - observe the effect and write it down in a spellbook
