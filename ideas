All the ideas, in one place. It'll be amazing if we implement 5% of these.
==========================================================================


Random Stuff:

- Narrator should be snarky.
  "your busted-ass armor has seen better days".
- 2nd 'over' map, showing connections to different maps, be them deeper into dungeons / caves, or further across land
- "Gauntlet" stages? Moving walls, spikes, action based play
- Inventory page - to include current armor and weapons, with lists of inventory to one side 

------------------


Add some more realism to combat / health

    - combat can damage different parts of your body in different ways. 
    - some kinds of damage can slow you down, weaken you, decrease abilities, etc.
    - some kinds of damage require time and rest to heal. 
        - After a bad injury, it may be necessary to exit the dungeon and seek aid. Hopefully you don't bleed out before you get out.
        - Would be cool if critical injuries lead to unconsciousness, but you are more likely to remain conscious as long as danger is nearby
          (example: you lose consciousness a few paces after exiting the dungeon; wake up later in the healer's hut)
    - need water / food / sleep
    - poisons can differ in strength and effect
    - would be nice if healers can give you advice about causes / treatments for your ailments.
        - with experience / training, player can determine these things on their own
    - detailed blow-by-blow logging of activities that lead to health problems so we can learn from our mistakes
    - head wounds can cause amnesia (forget parts of levels, skills, scroll effects, etc)
    - realistic interactions between offensive and defensive attributes. for example:
        - sharp weapons are ineffective against plate armor unless you have very good aim
        - heavy weapons are less effective against fast opponents
        - smiths can offer advice about the condition of equipment and how to repair it
        - with training / experience, the player can determine these things on their own

-------------------


Mobs
    - Generally sparse, but potentially more dangerous
    - Some mobs come in groups
    - Many personality attributes: timid/aggressive, passive/aggressive, 
    - Many are peaceful / avoid contact
    - May run away when hurt
    - May fight / avoid / help / react to other mobs
        - SJ Add threshold where flight becomes fight? E.g. chase a cat until it decides it is better to turn and fight you
    - May not notice you (depending on mob perception, your level of stealth, whether you stink, etc)
         - "hide" command?  Maybe "try to be sneaky" mode?

-------------------

More realism to skills / memory
    - You can forget parts of the maze that you haven't visited recently or frequently
    - Unused skills degrade over time (but with a realistic memory model)
    - Maps can be overlaid on the dungeon
    - Spells / potions can improve your memory
        - magic maps draw themselves as you explore and never forget
        - SJ "Enlightenment" & "Expanded Awareness" type spells could have a wicked visual effect e.g. enlightened areas expanding out from player location


-------------------


Characters die permanently, but dungeons are persistent. 
    - It is possible to leave resources behind for the next adventurer (maps, gold, treasure..)
    - It is possible to encounter the remains of dead adventurers, but there's a good chance their corpse has already been looted.
        (and you might find their stuff in the posession of nearby monsters); items that are found with monsters or found on corpse have undergone regular wear-over-time: see ITEMS section
    - You can spin up a new dungeon, but transferring a character to another dungeon incurs a skill / gold penalty (as if you spent a lot of time and money traveling to the next dungeon)
    - It is possible to find one-time-use spells of ressurect.  
 
--------------------

Inventory management
    - Avoid creating the temptation to mine / sell all items in the dungeon
    - Resale value is very low
    - Most corpses can be looted, but it's unlikely you'll find anything valuable. (crappy weapons, armor that doesn't fit, etc)
    - Realistic inventory - carry as many rings / scrolls as you like, but a spare suit of armor will encumber you.
    - Should be easy to drop pack for combat
    - weapons / armor have realistic degradation (don't get iron wet, on't throw spears at the wall, etc)



--------------------


Detail and perception
    - Lots of detail available if you examine everything
    - Caracters with higher perception will notice more detail, even without manually looking
    - features in the environment have both visibility (how likely you are to notice) and salience (how likely you are to care). 
        whether a feature shows up in the event log depends on (visibility * perception) * salience
    

---------------------

Portals
    - Advanced characters will have rare opportunities to open rifts / portals between levels to avoid long trips in/out of the dungeon
    - Be creative with graphics for these
        - Shift part of the map to open cracks
        - Dynamically open wormhole as you approach the portal
        - Remote end of the portal is visible through the portal 
        
---------------------

Terrain

    - Many types of terrain -- dungeons, caves, forest, water, etc
    - would be cool to have large ground level + multiple entrances to underground
 

    
    
---------------------


Gameplay

    - mixed realtime and turn-based play
    - for multiplayer, turn-based play operates locally
    - most parts gamepad playable
    - Use mouse / js for ranged weapon aiming
        skill affects accuracy
    - SJ "target line" / crosshair / laser pointer for aiming - maybe this is a spell? or always on in 'easy' gameplay mode
    - combination of rougelike and interactive fiction
        one panel gives a description of the local area
            descriptions can be hierarchical -- terse descriptions can be expanded
            SJ Expanding description trees need kybd shortcuts as to avoid unnecessary mouse clicks 
        one panel gives description of character state
        console for entering commands + event log
    - Pits / traps can sometimes be avoided, but this requires manual intervention from user and depends on player skill

    

------------------------

Player to NPC Dialogue
    
    Terms: 
        - Dialogue Matrix - the network of all possible dialogue options with an NPC (one Dialogue Matrix per NPC)
        - Dialogue Node - One statement or question made by Player (multiple choice) or NPC 
        - Dialogue Branch - A grouping of Dialogue Nodes
        - Dialogue Column - a specific conversational function e.g. an "Introduction" column, where NPC or Player introduces themselves by name. Dialogue Columns can contain Dialogue Nodes, and Dialogue Branches
        - Time Tier - An axis of the Dialogue Matrix used to help with selecting Dialogue Nodes and Branches
    
    - For all NPC interactions, a Dialogue Matrix will determine the conversation options
        - Each Dialogue Column will accomplish a conversational transaction with a specific information sharing and/or gameplay function
            - e.g. A Column named "Passing Greeting" will contain all of the Dialogue Nodes that NPC or Player can use when passing by each other (assuming that, conditionally, they decide to greet each other at all)
            - Dialogue columns can be ommitted entirely if unnecessary / inappropriate (e.g. if you know the shop keep by name, he doesn't introduce himself. The "Introduction" Column is forever ommitted within that NPC's Dialogue Matrix once you have been properly introduced (unless you or the shopkeep forget the other for whatever reason)) 
        - Dialogue variations will be determined by Dialogue Matrix Axes:
            - 1+ axis based on the nature of the relationship between conversating characters
                - Friendly/enemyly
            - Time spent since last conversation with NPC (Time Tiers)
                - Tiers of time-based conversational reset:
                    - Tier 1. First Ever: Greet and introduce NPC like it's the first time meeting NPC (unless the storyline dictates that the NPC in question is already well acquainted with Player, in which case)
                    - Tier 2. First in Recent History: If Player hasn't interacted with NPC in nnn hours playtime / nnn hours realtime, then greet appropriately
                    - Tier 3. Recent Interaction: e.g. If Player goes into a shop, buys something, leaves for 15 mins, then comes back into shop, the shop keep doesn't greet Player / doesn't say "Hello there!"
                    - Tier 4. Broken Interaction: e.g. Player buys something, then stops interacting with shop keep by leaving the store, and then goes straight back in. 
                    - Tier 5. Immediate Interaction: e.g. If you're in a shop and have already talked to the shop keep, and you bug them a 2nd time without breaking the interaction (e.g. by leaving the store), they don't greet you or ask what they can do for you again. Maybe just a considerate glance, or a "What else?" etc etc

                    ** Note Tier 5 could be a great opportunity for an NPC to offer random bits of information. e.g. You're hanging out near a drunk by the river, and every so often the drunk starts talking to you about something random. ('Them pointy toed shoes hurt!')

                - Time Tier 1 has its own column
                - Time Tier 2 has its own column
                - Time Tiers 3, 4, and 5 will share a column, as conversationally, they provide the same function, just differ by circumstantial branching conditions. In this case, Tiers 3, 4, and 5 all allow, for example, the shop keep to inquire as to how he can help you.
                    - e.g. 
                        - Assume player knows NPC (the shop keep) by name, ergo Time Tier 1 is conditionally omitted, meaning no introductions are made.
                        - Player walks into shop for the first time in 9 days: NPC greets Player using a Dialogue Node from the Dialogue Column containing Time Tier 2 interactions - "Hey there, nice to see you!"
                        - Then NPC continues with a Node from Column containing Time Tier 3 because this is the first time within nnn hours NPC is offering to help the customer, "What can I do for you?"
                        - Player buys something, and then leaves
                        - Player then immediately re-enters the shop, looking for something else to buy. 
                        - NPC pulls a Node from Time Tier 4, because the last interaction occurred quite recently, but Player stopped interacting with NPC by leaving the store (even if just for a moment).

                    - another e.g.
                        - Player is executing a nefarious plan with an NPC
                        - Player and NPC have agreed that the next thing Player needs to do is steal Suzy's magic wand
                        - Player stops interacting with NPC by leaving the area, and comes back 2 hours later. This meets conditions for Time Tier 3, so NPC draws a Node from "Player Returns After Agreeing to Plan" Column, "Time Tier 3" Branch, and says, "Did you get the wand?"
                        - Player did not get the wand, so he says "No", and the coversation loops back by nn Columns.

                        Alternate: 
                        - Player and NPC agree that Player must steal wand.
                        - Player leaves the area.
                        - Player comes back 2 minutes later
                        - NPC draws from Time Tier 4, saying "Whats up? Did you forget the plan already?"


                        In the Nefarious Plan examples above, the responses by NPC after <Player returns to the area> carry the same function: this is the "Player Returns After Agreeing to Plan" Column. However, because of the variance in the amount of time that Player spends away, NPC draws from different Time Tier branches (3 and 4, respectively).

                        ** Note: in this case, if Player returned after only 2 minutes away but had, in fact, successfully completed the quest step by stealing Suzy's wand, NPC would still draw from Tier 4, and this is OK! It is realistic for NPC to assume the wand was not stolen because Player was only away for 2 minutes. The selected Tier 4 Node, upon conditionally determining that the wand was successfully stolen, will continue to the next Column, "After Wand is Stolen", and will utilize the "From Tier 4" Branch. NPC might draw a Node that says "Wow, you're quite the thief!" 
            - Immediate Conditions axis
                - Are there dangerous monsters around?
                - Is the room completely dark, or near completely dark?
                - Is Player butt naked?





----------------------


Graphics

    Primarily text on a grid, especially early in the game
    Dynamic lighting (torches flicker, fireballs cast moving shadows, etc)
    particles for magic effects / explosions
    Depth? 
        ground level terrain can be 3D
        some parts of levels can be transparent to level below
    Parts of the map that are out of line-of-sight (by that you still remember) are desaturated / dimmed

    Since we can position each character individually / precisely in 3D, there is some opportuity for cool effects
        - Maybe break the 2D character grid as part of the story
         - A flatland-like setting, where magic is used to move in the 3rd dimension (for example, to walk through walls or teleport)
         - Rifts in the 2D spacetime continuum can actually mess up the grid

    Turn-based mode should be identified by boundary via colored floor area        

    Use unicode to represent many different items.
        - mandarin for scrolls / spells
        - kanji for weapons
        - cyrilic for monsters
        If we can work this out such that we start learning other languages, that would
        be fantastic (for example, phonetic symbols always have the same sound
        as the first letter of the english name)
        ^^ If using Mandarin, maybe the scroll symbol meanings could actually be representative of the spell being cast

-----------------------

DM mode

- Play as the dungeon master. You are given ample resources (minions, treasure, etc) to lure in and kill adventurers. 
- High-level heros are worth exponentially more, so there is incentive to allow them to level up as far as possible before killing them
  (but without getting killed yourself)
- Could be part of the story -- you can become DM by defeating the current one

-----------------------


Magic works somewhat like crafting / potion making in other games:

    - Basic magic spell components come in at least two categories:
        - "what" spells: fire, water, ice, healing, teleportation, force, psychic, etc.
        - "how" spells: apply to self, focus in a particular direction, 
           focus on a location, focus on an object, time delay, slow release, etc.
        - each component is represented by one unicode character (maybe mandarin?)
    - To make an effective spell, you usually need to combine at least a "what" with a "how". Examples:
        - fire spell on its own makes a poof of flame that probably harms the caster.
        - If you combine fire with a direction, you get fireball / flame thrower
        - Fire + shield creates a ring of fire around the caster
        - Fire + water + direction creates a blast of steam (or hot water, depending on the ratio)
    - Each component in a spell may be assigned a strength
        - maximum strength is determined by a player attribute
        - probability of success is determined by a _different_ attribute
          (so it's possible to have a prodigy magician who can cast very strong
           spells, but whose inexperience makes such spellcasting dangerous)
    - More complex / specialized / focused spells can be built by combining more basic spells 
        - but complex spells require greater ability
    - Most of the basic spell components are readily found in books (library, magic lessons, etc), 
        but some components may be out of reach for the average caster
        - Some long-forgotten spell components can only be found by adventuring
    - Player can cast any spell by entering the right "recipe"
    - Alternatively, Player can buy / find a blank book in which spell recipes can be recorded and referenced 
        by number / letter for quick use.
    - Many recipes can be found in books, on scrolls, scratched into walls, etc.
        - However, any recipe can be used regardless of whether you read it in a book
        - A user who understands how the elements work and how they interact should be able to 
            create new spells on their own
        - Dungeons shall not be littered with random scrolls and spellbooks.
        - Seriously, those items were looted 30 years ago by the original adventurers.
        (but hey, what if the game is set in a dystopian world 30 years after a horde of adventurers came, 
        looted all the dungeons, and then moved on to better games?)
        - Occasional items can be found on corpses, or in well protected / hidden areas
        - Items can also be purchased from the DND shoppe, or created custom by your local magicperson                    
    - Elements can interact in surprising ways
        - the order of elements can have a subtle effect
        - some elements augment / diminish the strength / duration / reliability of others
    - Your local magicparson can provide training (for a fee). This can increase your levels
    - The maximum strength / duration of a spell, and the probability of 
        casting it correctly, depend on the caster's ability.
        - It is dangerous to cast some spells when part of the spell is likely to fail
            (for example, don't try to cast fireball if there's a good chance the direction part of the spell will fail)
        - If a spell is way over your level, there is a chance of successfully casting the _wrong_ spell.
        - More complex spells will naturally require more skill, as each component has a certain probability
            of failure
        - To avoid making spells too dangerous to use, they should become very reliable
            with practice and after reaching a high enough level.
        - Player's skill is tracked for each element. Practice makes perfect.
            
    
    - Scrolls are one-time use and require no particular magical ability of the user
        - However, powerful scrolls are dangerous if you don't know how to use them properly
          (for example, dont blast the wall next to you with a fireball; the fire will have nowhere to go)
        - It is up to the player to be able to read the scroll and deduce its meaning.
            - observe the effect and write it down in a spellbook

Stores
    - limited inventory, stock turns over randomly
